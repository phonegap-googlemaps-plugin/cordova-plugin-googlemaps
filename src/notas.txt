2.8.1 - Quito CDVCommandDelegateImpl
Ver: https://github.com/mapsplugin/cordova-plugin-googlemaps/issues/2923
The problem is that the current version of this plugin uses the CDVCommandDelegateImpl class which has been changed from Public to Private in cordova-ios@7 
so is no longer available for the plugin to use.
